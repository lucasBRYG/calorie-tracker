.1: the circle progress bar working, some styling left to do. Also got calories burned total working.
.2: gonna add some stuff to the circle bar; instead of decreasing as you ingest more cals it will fill up, change color to green, fill animation, second ring that fills in red as you go over calorie goal
.3: check, check, and check. Wheel is working great. I have an idea to add some logic to continually add rings of new colors as they each fill up. For now I'm pretty happy with how it's all looking.
