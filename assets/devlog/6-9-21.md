#### 6.9.21

.1: Fixed alignment of progress wheel. I want to seperate some concerns and start commenting code but I want to get some features working first:
 - Daily score tracked over week
 - mobile/responsiveness
If I can get both of these things working today Ill spend tonight and tomorrow possibly working on bringing in an API to help gauge calorie intake from meals described by user. If not I'll just do some housecleaning and comenting tomorrow.
.2 Did not do any of this stuff... oh well lol
